    1. Vet
Create a class called Vet. Upon initialization, it should receive a name (string). It should also have an instance attribute called animals (empty list by default). There should also be 2 class attributes: animals (empty list) which will store the total amount of animals for all vets; and space (5 by default). You should create 3 additional instance methods:
    • register_animal(animal_name)
        ◦ If there is space in the vet clinic, adds the animal to both animals' lists and returns a message: "{name} registered in the clinic"
        ◦ Otherwise, returns "Not enough space"
    • unregister_animal(animal_name)
        ◦ If the animal is in the clinic, removes it from both animals' lists and returns "{animal} unregistered successfully"
        ◦ Otherwise, returns "{animal} not in the clinic"
    • info()
    • Returns info about the vet, the number of animals in his list and the free space in the clinic:
"{vet_name} has {number_animals} animals. {space_left_in_clinic} space left in clinic"
