    1. Vehicle
Create a class called Vehicle. Upon initialization, it should receive max_speed (integer, optional; 150 by default) and mileage (number).
Create an instance variable called gadgets - an empty list by default.

    Input: car = Vehicle(20)                     Output: 150
           print(car.max_speed)                          20
           print(car.mileage)                            []
           print(car.gadgets)                  	         ['Hudly Wireless']
           car.gadgets.append('Hudly Wireless')
           print(car.gadgets)
